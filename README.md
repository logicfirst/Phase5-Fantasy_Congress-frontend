# Phase5-Fantasy_Congress-frontend
Flatiron School Phase 5 Project - Fantasy Congress - React frontend
This was an individual project using React for the frontend framework and Rails as the backend server. Postgresql was used as the database. This application uses the US Senate and it's Senators as players in a game similar to fantasy football. The Senators are drafted and the game folows bills as they move through the process of being voted on. The application is still in its design and development phase with many more features to be added. The React backend repository can be found at Phase5-Fantasy_Congress-backend. https://youtu.be/Z0Qcg_z5lVQ
